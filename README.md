# My AWS repos and projects
Hello, world! I'm Josh Hayles.

This is my AWS repo section where I post AWS-related repos, projects, and links to my other publications.

My intentions are to grow this section into a valuable resource for all-things AWS.

Take a look at the current repos, click through them and dive in!

The following are a few goals and intentions:

# Goals
- To improve my skillsets around AWS products and services by building projects, demos, and writing about those experiences
- Bust through gray areas of understanding by diving deeper into a specific topic, and demonstrate as many tangible results as possible
- Improve my demonstration and communication abilities through technical writing projects
  - while improving my own understanding of AWS concepts through technical writing, I'm also working to be sure those who consume this content also gain a clear understanding of the topic I'm writing about
- Applying theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios by building functional applications using AWS services
- A showcase room for highlighting research, notes, projects, and examples from the AWS world
- Breaking down complex topics and subjects to smaller, digestible chunks
- Preparation for AWS Certifications
